### Introduction
This synthetic dataset offers information about each transaction within an online marketplace, including customer demographics such as gender and age, as well as purchase data. While it may not provide exhaustive customer details, it encompasses essential information crucial for analysis. Specifically designed to facilitate analytical and predictive purposes, it enables tasks such as trend analysis, examination of purchase behavior, market basket analysis, and customer churn prediction. By leveraging this dataset, companies and analysts can explore the dynamics of online consumer behavior, deriving valuable insights to inform strategic decision-making in e-commerce.

For this project, the primary focus will be on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) from various angles, including customer demographics, products, and sales timelines. Additionally, based on the findings, business recommendations and marketing strategies will be provided. The analysis will be carried out using Python Pandas and Plotly to perform data analytics tasks and create visualizations, following the 6-step data analysis process: Ask > Prepare > Process > Analyze > Share > Act.
